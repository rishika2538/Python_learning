# Python_learning
In this python learning repository you will understand about the list comprehension, dictionary comprehension, and lambda functions in Python.
# List comprehension
A Python list comprehension consists of brackets containing the expression, which is executed for each element along with the for loop to iterate over each element in the Python list. 
# Dictionary comprehension
Dictionary comprehension is a technique for creating Python dictionaries in one line. The method creates dictionaries from iterable objects, such as a list, tuple, or another dictionary. Dictionary comprehension also allows filtering and modifying key-value pairs based on specified conditions.
# Lambda Functions
A lambda function is a small anonymous function. A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.These Lambda Functions are the functions without a name. As we know  the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python. Similarly, the lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python.
